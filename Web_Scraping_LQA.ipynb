Upon questioning they turned off the zomato and swiggy platform for his franchise, for him to making no sale at all. they also took money from us in the start including GST, but upon checking in the portal our GST money that we paid to buy the franchise, cannot be seen anywhere. when we questioned them they were very rude and tried to change the topic and abused us. They have made a contract which has their own terms and conditions and was not discussed at the time of buying the franchise modal. now we have to do everything as they or we shut the business completely and bear the loss. For us its a lifetime investment but for them its peanuts. All other franchise owners are cursing them but they have signed the papers with them however we still have not signed the agreement with them yet, but started it on a good terms initially which later turned sour because of their unprofessionalism, betrayal, lies. kindly advice what action can be taken regarding this where we can go and report this as I would have to report this to save people for going into this scam.( West Delhi, Delhi )\",\n          \"Sir if department not notified RRs for post.

A commercial dispute is a disagreement relating to commerce between two or more stakeholders. These disputes generally arise in relation to contract terms and conditions, fiduciary duties, or intellectual property rights and may be settled through court proceedings or alternative dispute resolution(ADR). So, considering the nature of the dispute, you have to escalate your grievance before the Commercial Court for redress.

Once a plaintiff/complainant signs a Vakalatnama in f/o an Advocate authorizing him to represent his case before the Court, until and unless the physical appearance is required for evidence/examination, a plaintiff need not to nominate or authorize any other person at the time of delivery of judgment/order by the Court.  Instead, if so required, the plaintiff can execute a Power of Attorney in favour of a person to look after the liaisoning matter with the Advocate during his absence. But in case of any adverse order passed in the case that requires appeal before the higher Court, then the plaintiff being the appellant required to be present and sign the Appeal, Affidavits and Vakalatnama etc. afresh for filing the appeal before the Higher Court challenging the Order. ||| Dear client,It is important that you the plaintiff have to show up for the hearing.If the Plaintiff does not show up for the trial and the Defendant does appear, if the Defendant asks, the Court may dismiss the case without prejudice.  This means the Plaintiff may refile the case again within the statute of limitations.  But the Plaintiff must start all over with a new Notice of Claim and pay the filing fees (court costs) and service fees again.   The original filing fee and service fees will not be credited to the new filing and cannot be refunded.If the Plaintiff does refile the case and again fails to appear at trial, the Small Claims Rules say the Court may dismiss with case with prejudice.  A dismissal with prejudice will prevent the Plaintiff from ever being permitted to sue on the same dispute or claim.  A case dismissed with prejudice can never be refiled.  Small Claims Rule 10(A).If the Plaintiff fails to appear for the trial and the Defendant appears and has filed a counterclaim, the Judge may enter a default judgment against the Plaintiff based on the Defendant's counterclaim, assuming the Defendant satisfied all the requirements for a default judgment.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Number of Ans\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.vidhikarya.com/FreeLegalAdvice/63755/franchise-fraud\",\n          \"https://www.vidhikarya.com/FreeLegalAdvice/43422/macp\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
